# SPIxCONV

This project consists of an 18-bit analog input (ADC) and output (DAC) within a range of 20 V (Â± 10 V) and 32 digital pins that can be either as inputs or outputs. This system interfaces with pulsed power electronics hardware in order to control the output voltage for pulsed magnets as well as read and write status commands to their power supplies. An operator interface (OPI) software based on Qt was also developed for remote control.
